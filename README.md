# medium-article-ideas
A collection of ideas that I would like to translate into medium articles

* `NSUserActivity` and iOS 9 integration with Core Spotlight. A lot of the articles I found online neglected several gotchas when building this so this should be a quick look at how to integrate with Spotlight and what to look out for.
* Xcode schemes and building Apps that can be configured with different environments. Also answer the question of having multiple versions of an App run on a device at the same time
* 3D Touch integration - although this is pretty straight forward. But I could look at how to use Peek and Pop actions from an architectural perspective. The view controller being peaked isn't part of the hierarchy so how do we allow it to perform presentations etc...
* Mixed Swift and Obj-C Cocoapod
